# Bottom-Sheet-Paytm

## Setting state
Standard and modal bottom sheets have the following states:
* #### STATE_COLLAPSED#### : The bottom sheet is visible but only showing its peek height. This state is usually the 'resting position' of a bottom sheet, and should have enough height to indicate there is extra content for the user to interact with.
